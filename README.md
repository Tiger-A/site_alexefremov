Welcome to the Alexei Efremov AI Projects website! This site, created as an educational project using FastAPI, serves as a demonstration panel for simple artificial intelligence projects. I invite you to explore AI projects and conduct interesting experiments with them! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me at ajefrenov@gmail.com or via Telegram: @Lex_Je. I am open to communication and collaboration!

On the "MNIST" page, you can try to recognize handwritten digits using a neural network. Simply draw a digit with the mouse pointer in the input window and click the "Predict" button.
The neural network, based on the structure [now â€¦], was trained on images of digits from the MNIST dataset, achieving an accuracy of [...]. Now you can personally evaluate its performance by experimenting with handwritten digits.


On the "Segmentation" page, you can try out a neural network for image segmentation. Upload an image from your device featuring an airplane, or simply drag and drop the picture into the window.
This example showcases the functionality of a neural network for image segmentation. You'll observe how the model automatically highlights objects in the image, making them more distinct and understandable.
